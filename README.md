# Shopping List

This repository contains a simple shopping list application. You can add items, remove them and click the checkbox to denote you've successfully crossed the item off your list. 

It's a barebones example that can be taken in many directions. Here are some ways to explore extending this example:

- There is a bug currently where entering an "empty" item adds a blank row to the list. Can you fix this?
- Can the list be presented in a more attractive way using CSS?
- Could you make the list adapt itself better to mobile screen sizes?
- Is there a way to keep the list from adding an item if it is already present on the list?
- What if someone wanted to print this list? Did you know you can set [CSS styles for print](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media)? Maybe explore how you might style the elements differently when considering a printed version
- Can you add drag-and-drop functionality to change the order of thinsg on this list?
- Right now the "state" of our list lives and dies entirely in the DOM. What would be a better way to manage this list programmatically?
- Can you visually style the list items differently depending on their contents? A picture of an apple in the background of "apple" for example, or a pizza emoji next to the word pizza? How might you go about doing this?
- How might you extend this example to accommodate multiple lists?
